Simple Tic Tac Toe game bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and hosted on Firebase.

When you first load the game you need to add 2 names to start it.
The names need to be different otherwise you will get an error message.

Next page is the game where you can play and win.
When you finish the game you can start a new game or go to the results page.

In the results page you can see a leaderboard with all the players that have won the game.
